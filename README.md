# ZipProcesses-Python
Using Python's zipfile package to extract,create or list zip files without using WinZip.

Hello everyone!

I've just shared how to use Python's zipfile package by using the website below:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html

You can put many new codes and attributes into my code to improve it such as having zipfiles with password or etc. Help is always avaliable.

Stay with Python!
